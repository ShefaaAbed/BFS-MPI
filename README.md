# BFS-Breadth-First-Search

Serial part:

This code is to solve the 8-puzzle problem using the breadth first search algorithm.

Note that we will be having two 4’s and two 5’s in this problem and no 3 or 6. 

The program will ask the user to enter the starting position as a string (i.e. 142045578   the 0 is used for space).


Then the output should be the sequence of actions that will lead to the goal:

(0 1 2 4 4 5 5 7 8)

The output is:
1. Path of the solution (print the 8-puzzle).

2. Number of generated nodes.

3. Number of expanded nodes.

4. The moves/actions (Up,Down,Left and Right).


	
NOTE: Any action is illegal, ignore it.
